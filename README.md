# network_analysis

This codes scrapes tags from all datasets from https://datenregister.berlin.de/. Using a bigram and a cluster analysis, we perform a network analysis of dataset tags from the Berlin Open Data Portal. This allows us to understand which tags are common across themes, and which themes are typically closest to each other in terms of content. 

Scraping_Cleaning.R: Data scraping and analysis.

Visualization.R: Creation of data visualization using visNetwork.
